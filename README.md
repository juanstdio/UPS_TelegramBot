# APC UPS Telegram Bot
This implementation of the Telegram Bot was done to view the data from my APC 1500 UPS.
it is connected thorugh USB to my RaspberryPi Model 3. 
A service is attached to it and I can send or receive any notification from it.
I'll implementate a function to call a number when the power is off. 


### Requirements:
install apcupsd 
Install PyTelegramBotAPI, do not install TELEBOT.

This is my first attempt to perform a Telegram bot in Python 3.5
